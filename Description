Choosing the right career path is one of the most critical challenges faced by Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) students. Traditional career guidance methods rely heavily on academic scores, counselor opinions, and static information, which often fail to consider individual skills, interests, experience, and rapidly changing industry trends.

The AI-Enhanced Career Guidance System is a machine learning–based intelligent recommendation system designed to provide personalized, data-driven career suggestions for CSE and technology-oriented students. By leveraging supervised machine learning techniques, feature engineering, and structured preprocessing, the system predicts suitable career roles based on a user’s technical profile.

Objectives:

To eliminate bias and subjectivity in traditional career counseling

To handle data dependency by using multiple informative features

To address user diversity through personalized recommendations

To provide scalable and automated career guidance using ML

To help students make informed career decisions aligned with their skills and interests
